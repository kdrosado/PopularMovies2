# Phase 2: Trailers, Reviews, and Favorites

# User Experience
You’ll add more information to your movie details view:

- You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
- You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
- You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). 
- This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
- You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show 
their favorites collection.
